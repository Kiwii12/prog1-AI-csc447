How well does your network train?
It changes but gets no closer or farther from the answer.
What is the impact of network topology (i.e., changing the number of hidden layer nodes) on training?
The program will work with multiple hidden layers. However, no network typology will let it train.
How well does the network generalize from training data to testing data?
Due to not training, the percent right varies significantly.
