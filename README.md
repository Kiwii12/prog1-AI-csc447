Introduction: 
  Every spring ,  state  fire meteorologists attempt to predict  upcoming  fire season severity . Wildfire  severity  prediction  is  important  in  allocating  resources  for  fighting  forest  fires.  Many  factors  contribute to these predictions, including  drought conditions , available fuel, long  range weather  forecasts,  and  past  experience.  Artificial  neural  networks  are  often  used  in  prediction  and  forecasting, which suggests they may be applicable to this problem. 


Problem:
  Implement an artificial neural network program in C++ , using monthly PDSI measurements and  annual  burned acreage to train and test the ne t .  A multilayer feedforward error backpropagation  network (aka backprop net) is a reasonable choice for this application.
